# Autodesk Eagle Libraries for Pycom Microchips

These Eagle libraries are based on the [Pycom drawings](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-documentation/tree/master/chapter/datasheets) for their OEM microchips.  Work in progress.

Check yourself that you are happy that the libraries match the Pycom specs and are fit for your purposes.
